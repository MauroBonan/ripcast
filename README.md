Ripcast is a way to turn radio shows into podcasts in an automated way. 

Installation
------------
You will need `streamripper`. I installed it with Homebrew:

```
$ brew install streamripper
```

After that, 

```
$ python setup.py install
```
Should suffice to process python dependencies.

Usage
-----
```
$ bin/streamrip
```
